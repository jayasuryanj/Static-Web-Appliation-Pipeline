 Project Description:

**Title:** Simple Web Application Deployment Pipeline

**Duration:** December 2023 - December 2023

**Description:**
This project aims to set up a basic web application deployment pipeline using industry-standard DevOps practices and tools. The pipeline incorporates version control with Git, continuous integration with Jenkins, and cloud hosting on the AWS platform. The primary objective is to streamline the development workflow, enhance collaboration among team members, automate build and deployment processes, and ensure the reliability and scalability of the deployed web application.

**Key Components:**
1. **Version Control with Git:** Utilize Git for source code management, enabling team members to collaborate, track changes, and maintain version history effectively.
   
2. **Continuous Integration with Jenkins:** Implement Jenkins to automate the build and testing of the web application upon each code commit. Jenkins facilitates early detection of integration issues, ensures code quality, and accelerates the feedback loop for developers.

3. **Cloud Platform (AWS):** Host the web application on AWS to leverage its scalability, reliability, and global reach. Utilize services such as Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, and AWS IAM for access control and security.

**Demonstration Steps:**

1. **Setup Git Repository:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub for the web application.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file and necessary project structure.
   - Push the initial codebase to the GitHub repository.

2. **Configure Jenkins:**
   - Install Jenkins on a local server or use a cloud-based Jenkins instance.
   - Set up Jenkins to integrate with the GitHub repository.
   - Configure Jenkins jobs to trigger builds and tests upon code commits.

3. **AWS Setup:**
   - Create an AWS account if not already available.
   - Set up AWS services required for hosting the web application (S3, CloudFront, IAM).
   - Configure AWS IAM roles and policies to allow Jenkins to interact with AWS services.

4. **Deployment Pipeline:**
   - Define a deployment pipeline in Jenkins, comprising stages for build, test, and deployment.
   - Integrate deployment steps to deploy the built artifacts to AWS S3 and invalidate CloudFront cache if necessary.
   - Implement error handling and notifications within the pipeline.

5. **Testing and Monitoring:**
   - Implement automated tests within the Jenkins pipeline to validate the functionality and performance of the web application.
   - Set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch to track application metrics and detect any operational issues.

6. **Documentation and Demonstration:**
   - Document the project setup, configurations, and deployment pipeline steps comprehensively.
   - Create a README.md file in the GitHub repository outlining the project overview, setup instructions, and demonstration steps.
   - Prepare a demonstration video or presentation showcasing the deployment pipeline in action, highlighting key features and benefits.

By following these steps, you can effectively demonstrate the implementation of a simple web application deployment pipeline using Git, Jenkins, and AWS on GitHub. Ensure to provide clear documentation and instructions for others to understand and replicate the setup.
